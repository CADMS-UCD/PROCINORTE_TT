[Let's do some brief introductions:]{.black}

## Why R? {background-image="img/bg.png"}

<br/>

::: incremental
-   [It's FREE!]{.black}
-   [Open source]{.black}
-   [Runs in any OS]{.black}
-   [Programming languages are great for collaboration and replicable research]{.black}
:::

::: notes
-   R is free! the version we will use runs in the cloud with limited resources for free, plans are available if more resources needed.. but also, everything we will learn in this workshop is directly applicable for the R desktop version, which will be able to use all the resources available in your computer.
-   R is open source, this means anyone can contribute to improve R and create new functions.. and yes there is a looot of people doing this just for the sake of open science (which measn that science should be as accessible and easy to do for everyone)
-   Runs in any OS, as opposed to other software coff coff ARC GIS and \@Risk, R can be run in Windows, Linux, MAC and other os using the cloud version
-   As opposed to software that relies completely in UI, programming allows you to document every step of your work, meaning that you can come back to your code years later, and if documented properly, you shouldnt worry to much about remembering off the top of your head exactly what you did and in what order

## What is this workshop? {background-image="img/bg.png"}

<br/>

::: incremental
-   [This workshop is an introduction to R]{.black}
-   [DO NOT EXPECT TO MASTER R AFTER THE WORKSHOP]{.black}
-   [If you already have experience with R, is always nice to see how other people do things, so feel free to share!]{.black}
:::

::: notes
-   This workshop is an introduction to R, we will cover A LOT of material in a brief time, so please be patient.
-   Do not expect that by the end of the workshop you will master all the topics covered, mastering R takes time and the more you do it the easier it gets. All the materials will remain accessible online for you to review and feel free to reach anytime in the future for questions

# Some programming concepts {background-image="img/bg_title.png"}

## [Comments]{style="color:black;"} {background-color="black" background-image="img/bg_2.png"}

COMMENT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
# This is a comment in R it will be only for the user
This is not a comment and will cause an error
```

What is the difference between line 1 and 2?

. . .

YES! the `#` character will make everything after it a comment in that line of code

. . .

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
10 + 10 # Everything after will be a comment
7 + 4
```

::: notes
Comments are probably the most important feature of programming languages, commenting your code is not only for you (and feature you), it's also to explain other people what you did and make it easier for them to replicate
:::

## [Operators]{style="color:black;"} {background-color="black" background-image="img/bg_2.png"}

Operators are characters with a specific function in R for example

```{r echo = T}
3 + 3 # this is a sum operator
3 - 2 # this is a subtract operator
4 * 4 # This is a multiplication
```

. . .

Later we will see other kind of operators, but... DONT STRESS about learning everything.

## [Objects]{style="color:black;"} {background-color="black" background-image="img/bg_2.png"}

Objects in R are containers for information, we can create objects with any names we want that start with a letter

```{r echo = T}
myNumber <- 4
myResult <- 4 * 5
```

::: notes
Does anyone notice what operators are we using in those lines of code?
:::

## [Boolean logic]{style="color:black;"} {background-color="black" background-image="img/bg_2.png"}

```{r echo = T}
1 == 1 # is it equal?
1 != 1 # is it NOT equal?
1 %in% c(1, 2, 3) # is the number contained in the sequence?
```

. . .

Notice that we are using operators to make the comparisons

## [Functions]{style="color:black;"} {background-color="black" background-image="img/bg_2.png"}

Functions are a special kind of object. Functions are objects that require arguments, the arguments needs to be inside parentheses.

```{r echo = T}
# create a sequence of numbers
seq(
  from = 0, # Starting number
  to = 80, # Ending number
  by = 20 # number increment of the sequence
) 
```

. . .

Notice that the arguments are named in the function, the arguments in the function `seq()` function are `from`, `to`, `by`.

. . .

We can create our own functions, which we will talk more about in the labs

## [Storing multiple elements]{style="color:black;"} {background-color="black" background-image="img/bg_2.png"}

Using the `c()` function

```{r echo = T}
x <- c(1, 3, 5) # using the c() function
x
```

. . .

Using the `list()` function

```{r echo = T}
y <- list(1, 3, 5) # using the list() function
y
```

## [Test time!]{style="color:black;"} {background-color="black" background-image="img/bg_2.png"}

```{r echo=T}
x <- seq(from = 5, to = 23, length.out = 10) # create a sequence of numbers
y <- seq(from = 0.1, to = 0.78, length.out = 10) # Create another sequence
mean(x*y) # Get the mean of the multiplication
```
