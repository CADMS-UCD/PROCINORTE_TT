-   [Experience with R]{.black}

## Why R? {background-image="img/bg.png"}

<br/>

::: incremental
-   [It's FREE!]{.black}
-   [Open source]{.black}
-   [Runs in any OS]{.black}
-   [Programming languages are great for collaboration and reproducible research]{.black}
:::

::: notes
-   R is free! the version we will use runs in the cloud with limited resources for free, plans are available if more resources needed.. but also, everything we will learn in this workshop is directly applicable for the R desktop version, which will be able to use all the resources available in your computer.
-   R is open source, this means anyone can contribute to improve R and create new functions.. and yes there is a looot of people doing this just for the sake of open science (which measn that science should be as accessible and easy to do for everyone)
-   Runs in any OS, as opposed to other software coff coff ARC GIS and \@Risk, R can be run in Windows, Linux, MAC and other os using the cloud version
-   As opposed to software that relies completely in UI, programming allows you to document every step of your work, meaning that you can come back to your code years later, and if documented properly, you shouldnt worry to much about remembering off the top of your head exactly what you did and in what order

## What is this workshop? {background-image="img/bg.png"}

<br/>

::: incremental
-   [This workshop is an introduction to R]{.black}
-   [DO NOT EXPECT TO MASTER R AFTER THE WORKSHOP]{.black}
-   [If you already have experience with R, is always nice to see how other people do things, so feel free to share!]{.black}
:::

::: notes
-   This workshop is an introduction to R, we will cover A LOT of material in a brief time, so please be patient.
-   Do not expect that by the end of the workshop you will master all the topics covered, mastering R takes time and the more you do it the easier it gets. All the materials will remain accessible online for you to review and feel free to reach anytime in the future for questions
