# Posit Cloud

In this workshop we will be using posit cloud, which is a web based platform to use R without the need of installing any software. All the concepts covered in this workshop are directly transferable to R and Rstudio, if you prefer to use R and R studio you are welcome to use it, but the workshop will focus on posit cloud.
